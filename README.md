## What is "Vibe Coding"?

Vibe coding is about creating projects that prioritize aesthetic, feeling, and experience over pure functionality. It's code that makes you *feel* something - whether that's:
- Calming and meditative
- Energizing and dynamic
- Nostalgic and retro
- Futuristic and sleek
- Playful and whimsical
